Ahmad's CV
=================

I don't know how to properly write a **CV** on [docs.new](http://docs.new) or any word processor basically.

So I decided to roll it out with HTML ans CSS. I used [SPECTRE.CSS](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/) as a layout framework,
and I am so happy with the outcome, hence am sharing it with you, so you can customize it for yours if you wish.

PS
=================
I used inline `css`, I know, I am really sorry...

I also didn't have proper convention for the `css` rules, if you feel sad, don't.. ðŸ˜˜
